This is a WordPress plugin written for [Spark SF](http://sparksf.org).
It handles payments with Stripe and saves user data to Salesforce.

The Stripe side is caspable of being set up with any Stripe account. The plugin will set up the plans for subscriptions, and everything else is handled per request. Only setup required is to set your secret and public keys in the plugin settings page at wp-admin > Settings > Spark Donation Form

You'll also notice the Salesforce user information, which isn't as simple. The plugin depends on the existence of a custom Contact object, and several custom fields for that object to save the data from the form.

Several emails are generated at donation time, using templates from Salesforce. These must also exist for the plugin to work. To receive alerts of new payments, edit the sdf.php and find the constant value $SPARK_TEAM. Emails in that array will get notifications.

The form markup is generated when the proper page slug is loaded. This is set to 'donate' as the default.

You should have an SSL certificate set up. The page automatically redirects people to https://
